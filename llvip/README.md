# Annotations and Codes for LLVIP dataset

Note that we experimented with the KAIST dataset as our primary dataset.

The original annotations are in VOC format. We evaluate in annotations that have been modified to COCO format for consistency with the experiments in the KAIST dataset.

If you want to experiment with the LLVIP dataset, please modify some paths in the code.

Please note that the codes are the same file name as those in the [INSANet/src](https://github.com/sejong-rcv/INSANet/tree/main/src) to avoid any misunderstandings.

If you have any trouble, please feel free to contact us via [Issues](https://github.com/sejong-rcv/INSANet/issues).
